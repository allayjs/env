- **`Env` class** in `env.ts` to handle, validate, and parse environment variables with methods for creation, setting, and retrieving values.
- **`E_INVALID_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES` exception class** in `exceptions.ts` for handling invalid environment variables.
- **Export** of `Env` class, exceptions, and validation types in `index.ts`.

These changes introduce robust tools for environment variable management including creation, validation, parsing, and exception handling to improve application configuration processes.
